# A Java web application to encrypt and decrypt files

* AES algorithm is used for encryption and decryption. Instead of using a traditional method to generate a key , we have used hierarchical tree key generation algorithm to generate a key.
* Along with the datafile (the file to be encrypted) the user provides a key file (the file to generate the key).
* The data file is encrypted using the key generated by the key file using hierarchical tree key generation algorithm.
* If the user wants to decrypt the file,he has to provide the same key file which was provided during encryption.
* Once the decryption is done he can download the file.
